# Project-1
Our group chose a cancer dataset containing general patient data from various counties in each state. We analyzed different aspects of the original dataset by demonstrating the relationships that different columns of data had with one another in order to answer the following questions:
Is there a correlation between income and cancer rates?
What is the poverty percent rate per state vs median age per state?
Do older populations have greater or lower poverty rates?
Does a higher percent of married households correlate with lower incidences of death as the outcome?
Based on the incidence of cancer for each state, what percentage of cancer incidences result in death in each state on average?
What is the relationship between unemployment and cancer incidence for each state?
Does having private insurance vs public insurance correlate with higher or lower death percentages?

In order to more clearly demonstrate the insights that our analysis created visualizations were created to display our findings.
